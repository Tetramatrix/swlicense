Better PHP License Manager System: Manage licenses for software customers

This package can manage licenses for software customers.

It provides one class that takes the details of a given customer of a software system like his name and email address.

The software customer object can be passed to other classes that perform operations to manage license like:

- Add or buy a license with options to limit to a single or unlimited uses
- Add or delete a Web site URL to be associated to a software license
- Display details of a customer, license options or associated Web sites of a software license
